# Resource Databases
Resource Databases is a Godot 4 plugin that aims to solve the problem of data management inside your projects.
While it makes more sense to use this plugin for medium/large projects, it is still useful for any kind of development.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This was a tool intended for my personal use, but as more people found it useful, I will try to maintain it with constant updates. Feedback is really useful, if you find any **bugs**, or want to request **new features** (inside the plugin's scope), please open an ***issue*** in this repository.

## Features ‚≠ê
 - ***Fully-fledged database editor*** integrated inside Godot.
 - **Databases** can handle multiple collections of ***custom*** or ***built-in*** resources, using UIDs as well as paths to load them later.
 - Use ***categories*** to organize the resources inside each collection.
 - Use ***expressions*** for more complex filtering and organization.
 - Access your resources at ***runtime*** using the multiple Database methods.
